# Generative AI with Python & PyTorch – Practice Repo

This repository contains my code, experiments, and notes as I work through **Generative AI with Python and PyTorch** (Packt).

The goal of this repo is to:

- Re-implement and understand key concepts from the book  
- Build small generative AI projects (images, text, etc.)  
- Experiment with model tweaks, training tricks, and custom ideas  
- Track my learning progress over time

> _Note: This is a learning repo. Code may be experimental, messy, or incomplete._

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Core library:** PyTorch  
- **Environment:** Google Colab

Other libraries I’ll likely use:

- `numpy`, `pandas` – data handling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` or similar – visualizations
- `torchvision` / `datasets` – dataset utilities
- `tqdm` – progress bars
- `pyyaml` or `json` – config files
